# 8-bit CPU From Scratch  

### Overview  
This project showcases a custom-designed 8-bit CPU, built entirely from scratch. The design includes hardware logic, machine code, and assembly language support, with a simple counter running on an LCD as a demonstration.  

### Files Included  
- `cpu.circ`: Circuit design of the CPU in Logisim.  
- `opcode.txt`: Opcode reference for supported instructions and the code for Counter program.  
- `rom_micro_code`: Microcode definitions
