# 8-bit CPU From Scratch  

### Overview  
This project showcases a custom-designed 8-bit CPU, built entirely from scratch. The design includes hardware logic, machine code, and assembly language support, with a simple counter running on an LCD as a demonstration.  

### Features  
- **Custom Hardware Design**: Built using [your tools/software, e.g., Logisim].  
- **Machine Code and Assembly**: Supports a basic set of operations to execute assembly instructions.  
- **Counter Implementation**: Demonstrates functionality with a counter running on an LCD.  

### Files Included  
- `cpu.circ`: Circuit design of the CPU.  
- `opcode.txt`: Opcode reference for supported instructions.  
- `rom_micro_code`: Microcode definitions for the CPU.  

### How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/souvik131/cpufromscratch.git
